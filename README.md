## Getting Started

This project uses Java, hence to run it, you machine should be Java enabled. To compile this project you are going to need maven, however, if you don't want to compile from source, there are releases you can use.

### Prerequisites

Following prerequisites are required, depending on your usage.

#### Java

You need Java JDK to execute this application. This application uses JavaFX library for its UI. The latest version of Java that supports JavaFX is Java v8, so none of the above versions are going to work with this application. If you are on Linux, note that JavaFX is removed from `openjdk-8-jdk` and you must use the version provided by Oracle.

#### Maven

You are going to need Maven only if you are compiling from source. You can install Maven using the following command if you are on a Linux machine.

```
sudo apt install maven
```

### Compilation

You can compile the code via the following command.

```
mvn package
```

The result of compilation is a `.jar` file, that you can find in the `target` director. The file is going to be named `PGen-*.*-jar-with-dependencies.jar` where the `*.*` is going to be the version of the binary.

### Execution

You can run the executable with the following command.

```
java -jar target/PGen-*.*-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
